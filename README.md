# Data-Analysis-and-Interactive-Reports


## Interative Sales Insights Report

For this project at work I was tasked to develop an interactive report for an auction-based client who wanted to see trends in their lots that were being bid on historically, as well as performance month over month. With this in mind, I developed a 7-page interactive report of their historic data in order to show trends in sales, and painpoints that needed to be resolved. Additionally, this report helped spot key trends in seasonality and category of lots being bid on. This involved using MySQL to pull all 15 years of their historic data, cleaned extensively in Python, and developed within Microsoft's Power BI.
