# Data-Analysis-and-Interactive-Reports
Analysis and transformation of data done as an analyst for a start-up advertising agency.




## Interative Sales Insights Report

For this project at work I was tasked to develop an interactive report for an auction-based client who wanted to see trends in their lots that were being bid on historically, as well as performance month over month. With this in mind, I developed a 7-page interactive report of their historic data in order to show trends in sales, and painpoints that needed to be resolved. Additionally, this report helped spot key trends in seasonality and category of lots being bid on. This involved using MySQL to pull all 15 years of their historic data, cleaned extensively in Python, and developed within Microsoft's Power BI.

## Sales Insights Report

Insights report visualizing the difference in spend for a client between the years 2017 and 2018, and noting changes seen between years. The purpose of the report was to highlight that we were able to drive down our average cost per click while spending the majority of our budget in "Cold" audiences in our 2nd year, or people who aren't familiar with the brand. Additionally, while scaling into a sector of consumers unfamiliar with the brand, we minimized losses the return on investment, keeping the average ROI above 8:1. This is due to the notion that solely targeting returning customers eventually exhausts your consumer base, and results in diminishing returns. For a company hoping to scale fast, we needed to diversify our targeting in order to effectively drive new people into the sales funnel. This allowed for us to allocate spend flexibly across campaigns in years three and four.

## First-time Customer Data Analysis

This project involved pulling data from our social media marketing campaigns and analyzing the trends seen between advertising spend and first time customer purchases, in order to determine the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns that were live. Once data was normalized, outliers were ruled out and a correlation analysis was done to show a statistical significance between the monthly advertising spend and monthly sales. A weakly positive correlation between daily ad spend and sales were shown as well, but was later explained to be expected since customer behavior fluctuates dramatically depending on the varying types of ads shown.
