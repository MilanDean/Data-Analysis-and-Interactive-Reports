## Interative Report for Client

For this project at work I was tasked to develop an interactive report for an auction-based client who wanted to see trends in their lots that were being bid on historically, as well as performance month over month. This involved using MySQL to pull all 15 years of their historic data, cleaned up extensively in Python, and developed within Microsoft's Power BI.
